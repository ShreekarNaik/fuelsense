A smart Fuelsense Backend powered by AI/ML that predicts fuel consumption, detects anomalies, and generates actionable insights to optimize fleet operations.

## Overview

This platform helps manage and optimize fuel usage for equipment fleets by:

-   Predicting upcoming fuel consumption using historical patterns
-   Detecting anomalies such as fuel theft, inefficiency, and mechanical issues
-   Generating actionable insights for operational improvements
-   Presenting data through an interactive dashboard

## Models

### Consumption Predictor

Uses machine learning to predict future fuel consumption based on historical data, equipment characteristics, and environmental factors.

### Anomaly Detector

Combines statistical methods and machine learning to detect unusual patterns in fuel consumption and equipment operation.

### Insight Generator

Analyzes data to generate actionable recommendations for improving efficiency and reducing costs.
